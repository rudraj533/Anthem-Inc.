One key factor is the rising disposable income in both developed and emerging economies, which has led to increased spending on pets' healthcare needs. Pet owners are now more inclined to spend on treatments and medical procedures that enhance their pets' health and quality of life. Moreover, advancements in veterinary medical devices and technologies, such as wearable health trackers and digital health tools, are improving the accuracy and efficiency of treatments. Additionally, the growing awareness about the importance of animal health among consumers has led to more regular check-ups, preventive care, and early disease detection, further boosting demand for veterinary services. Veterinary hospitals and clinics are expanding their service offerings, from basic healthcare to specialized services like oncology, orthopedics, and dermatology, making healthcare for pets more comprehensive.
